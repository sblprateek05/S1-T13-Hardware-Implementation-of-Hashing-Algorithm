## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Detail</summary>
  
  > Motivation: The motivation behind this project is to address the performance bottlenecks
faced by software implementations of the SHA-256 hash function, especially in resource-
constrained environments like embedded systems and IoT devices. By implementing SHA-
256 in hardware, we aim to achieve significant improvements in processing speed and power
efficiency, which are critical for optimizing security and performance in these applications.
  > Problem Statement: Traditional software implementations of SHA-256 can suffer from per-
formance limitations, particularly in systems with strict timing and power requirements. This
creates challenges for applications that require both robust security and efficient performance,
highlighting the need for a more effective solution.
  > 3. Features:
• Hardware implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm.
• Significant improvements in processing speed and power efficiency compared to software
solutions.
• Optimization for small inputs and a considerable number of hashing functions.
• Viability for applications that require enhanced security and performance optimization.
• SHA-256 enable parallel data block processing, enhancing hash computation speed, espe-
cially in hardware implementations.
