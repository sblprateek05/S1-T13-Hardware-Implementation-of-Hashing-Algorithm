## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Detail</summary>
  
   > Motivation: The motivation behind this project is to address the performance bottlenecks
faced by software implementations of the SHA-256 hash function, especially in resource-
constrained environments like embedded systems and IoT devices. By implementing SHA-
256 in hardware, we aim to achieve significant improvements in processing speed and power
efficiency, which are critical for optimizing security and performance in these applications.
  
   > Problem Statement: Traditional software implementations of SHA-256 can suffer from performance
limitations, particularly in systems with strict timing and power requirements. This
creates challenges for applications that require both robust security and efficient performance,
highlighting the need for a more effective solution.
  
   > Features:
  <br>• Hardware implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm.
  <br>• Significant improvements in processing speed and power efficiency compared to software solutions.
  <br>• Optimization for small inputs and a considerable number of hashing functions.
  <br>• Viability for applications that require enhanced security and performance optimization.
  <br>• SHA-256 enable parallel data block processing, enhancing hash computation speed, especially in hardware implementations.
